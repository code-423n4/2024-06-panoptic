*Not compliant to the letter, does not include any metadata functionality.*


## State Variables
### balanceOf
Token balances for each user.

*Indexed by user, then by token id.*


```solidity
mapping(address account => mapping(uint256 tokenId => uint256 balance)) public balanceOf;
```


### isApprovedForAll
Approved addresses for each user.

*Indexed by user, then by operator.*

*Operator is approved to transfer all tokens on behalf of user.*


```solidity
mapping(address owner => mapping(address operator => bool approvedForAll)) public isApprovedForAll;
```


## Functions
### setApprovalForAll

Approve or revoke approval for `operator` to transfer all tokens on behalf of the caller.


```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) public;
```

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`operator`|`address`|The address to approve or revoke approval for|
|`approved`|`bool`|True to approve, false to revoke approval|


### safeTransferFrom

Transfer a single token from one user to another.

*Supports approved token transfers.*


```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) public virtual;
```

|`from`|`address`|The user to transfer tokens from|
|`to`|`address`|The user to transfer tokens to|
|`id`|`uint256`|The ERC1155 token id to transfer|
|`amount`|`uint256`|The amount of tokens to transfer|
|`data`|`bytes`|Optional data to include in the `onERC1155Received` hook|


### safeBatchTransferFrom

Transfer multiple tokens from one user to another.

*Supports approved token transfers.*

*`ids` and `amounts` must be of equal length.*


```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] calldata ids,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    bytes calldata data
) public virtual;

|`amounts`|`uint256[]`|The amounts of tokens to transfer|
|`data`|`bytes`|Optional data to include in the `onERC1155Received` hook|


### balanceOfBatch

Query balances for multiple users and tokens at once.

*`owners` and `ids` should be of equal length.*


```solidity
function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata owners, uint256[] calldata ids)
    public
    view
    returns (uint256[] memory balances);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`owners`|`address[]`|The list of users to query balances for|
