Facilitates deployment of Panoptic pools.


## State Variables
### UNIV3_FACTORY
The Uniswap V3 factory contract to use.


```solidity
IUniswapV3Factory internal immutable UNIV3_FACTORY;
```


### SFPM
The Semi Fungible Position Manager (SFPM) which tracks option positions across Panoptic Pools.


```solidity
SemiFungiblePositionManager internal immutable SFPM;
```


### POOL_REFERENCE
Reference implementation of the `PanopticPool` to clone.


```solidity
address internal immutable POOL_REFERENCE;
```


### COLLATERAL_REFERENCE
Reference implementation of the `CollateralTracker` to clone.


```solidity
address internal immutable COLLATERAL_REFERENCE;
```


### WETH
Address of the Wrapped Ether (or other numeraire token) contract.


```solidity
address internal immutable WETH;
```


### FULL_RANGE_LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT_WETH
An amount of `WETH` deployed when initializing the SFPM against a new AMM pool.

*If we know one of the tokens is WETH, we deploy 0.1 ETH worth in tokens.*


```solidity
uint256 internal constant FULL_RANGE_LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT_WETH = 0.1 ether;
```


### FULL_RANGE_LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT_TOKEN
An amount of another token that's deployed when initializing the SFPM against a new AMM pool.

*Deploy 1e6 worth of tokens if not WETH.*


```solidity
uint256 internal constant FULL_RANGE_LIQUIDITY_AMOUNT_TOKEN = 1e6;
```


### CARDINALITY_INCREASE
The `observationCardinalityNext` to set on the Uniswap pool when a new PanopticPool is deployed.


```solidity
uint16 internal constant CARDINALITY_INCREASE = 100;
```


### s_getPanopticPool
Mapping from address(UniswapV3Pool) to address(PanopticPool) that stores the address of all deployed Panoptic Pools.


```solidity
mapping(IUniswapV3Pool univ3pool => PanopticPool panopticPool) internal s_getPanopticPool;
```


## Functions

### uniswapV3MintCallback

Called after minting liquidity to a position.

*Pays the pool tokens owed for the minted liquidity from the payer (always the caller).*

### deployNewPool

Create a new Panoptic Pool linked to the given Uniswap pool identified uniquely by the incoming parameters.

*There is a 1:1 mapping between a Panoptic Pool and a Uniswap Pool.*

*A Uniswap pool is uniquely identified by its tokens and the fee.*

*Salt used in PanopticPool CREATE2 is [leading 20 msg.sender chars][leading 20 pool address chars][salt].*


```solidity
function deployNewPool(address token0, address token1, uint24 fee, uint96 salt, uint256 amount0Max, uint256 amount1Max)
    external
    returns (PanopticPool newPoolContract);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`token0`|`address`|Address of token0 for the underlying Uniswap v3 pool|
|`token1`|`address`|Address of token1 for the underlying Uniswap v3 pool|
|`fee`|`uint24`|The fee tier of the underlying Uniswap v3 pool, denominated in hundredths of bips|
|`salt`|`uint96`|User-defined component of salt used in CREATE2 for the PanopticPool (must be a uint96 number)|
|`amount0Max`|`uint256`|The maximum amount of token0 to spend on the full-range deployment, which serves as a slippage check|
|`amount1Max`|`uint256`|The maximum amount of token1 to spend on the full-range deployment, which serves as a slippage check|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newPoolContract`|`PanopticPool`|The address of the newly deployed Panoptic pool|


### minePoolAddress

Find the salt which would give a Panoptic Pool the highest rarity within the search parameters.

*The rarity is defined in terms of how many leading zeros the Panoptic pool address has.*

*Note that the final salt may overflow if too many loops are given relative to the amount in `salt`.*


```solidity
function minePoolAddress(address deployerAddress, address v3Pool, uint96 salt, uint256 loops, uint256 minTargetRarity)
    external
    view
